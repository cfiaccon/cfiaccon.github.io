**Chris M. Fiacconi** is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.uoguelph.ca/psychology/) at the [University of Guelph](https://www.uoguelph.ca) (located in Guelph, Ontario, Canada). I am a cognitive psychologist with research interests in the areas of human memory and metacognition.

My research program is broadly centered on understanding the cognitive processes that support learning and memory. I am particularly interested how we retrieve information from memory and in the inferential processes that guide the monitoring, assessment and regulation of learning. This work aims to both advance our understanding of basic learning and memory principles, and to enhance the effectiveness of self-regulated learning strategies in educational settings.

I also teach a variety of courses within the Psychology Department at the University of Guelph. Under the **Teaching** section, you can find various materials that I have prepared for both undergraduate and graduate courses in statistics and computer programming. I am an enthusiast of the [R programming environment](https://r-project.org), and I will post materials on how to use *R* for statistical analyses and other data-related operations.
